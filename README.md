**Kroma**: Nexus Architecture for Hybrid AI/ML Cloudless Scale-Free Paradigm

Browser Native Edge ”BNE” is heterdox standards-based hyperlocal hybrid architecture, decentralizing infrastructure providing a “cloudless” WebRTC/WS overlay establishing routing from SDP endpoints and classic client-server mirror for hybrid level 0 unitary networking and local supercomputing environment.

* Cloudless Architecture: Decentralized, no central server dependency
* BNEC: Browser-native edge computing, local real-time processing
* Isomorphic Logic: Unified code execution across nodes
* Hybrid Mutable-Immutable State: Stable core, dynamic mutable updates
* Chrome Redefined: No server dependencies, cloudless app abstraction
* Ambient Supercomputing: Distributed, browser-based peer-to-peer computing
* Self-Organizing Networks: Autonomous, fault-tolerant decentralized network
* Event-Driven Microservices: Distributed architecture for real-time processes


BNE computing fundamentally delimits and decouples meaning of conventional client-server app and userspace boundary aka browser “chrome,” in any modern browser or chromeless runtime. Offers actual serverless browser-native common serving API for spontaneous existence, scaling, and persistence. This happens via peer mesh in containerized DOM coworker optionally caching public aiware artefacts on IPFS. Kroma also supplies a lean WASM Linux VM to be used for ML and headless in-browser browser automation and Python driven ML CLI that uses Signals with WebStorage to sync
