The primary order for AKA fundamental design is this, altruistically disruptive, architecture
but can not deform and not conform to these precepts and inalienable purposes:


**BNEC - Browser Native Edge Compute**

**Primary postulates:** 
 
#1  : The browser is fundamental 'cloudless' computing unit environment
	
Servers become practically meaningless akin just referring to older alternative paradigm we do not use except to reappropriate client/server 'boundary' into the very essence o. f Kroma.
	
An isomorphic "unitary" environment (Browser: JS/IWASM/VM)

#2 : The unitary model operates where clients-servers are always one and key to collective scaling. 

#3 : Infrastructure as Code in userspace, where user is a human or agentic entity.                 

The browser becomes synonymous with the client and the server at once, and subsequently as a peer server or client.
To semantically realize and engineer unprecedented 'cloudless' decentralized (over Smoke's WebRTC) computing architecture via intense vertical modifications of client-server discovery and embedding. This is semantically similar to increasingly popular contemporary 'serverless' containers decoupling state and environment from server-side programs. 
	
Primary constraints:
1.  Create an independent discovery and address signaling, networking, session-ing over overlay network definition [2]
2.  "Visual and Classical Start and Join" of Obsidiain repo for signaling mechanism description. 

Classic and Status Quo: consensual human and agent browser mediated spaces we formed through a duality paradigm of centralization called client-server that thrived, thrives, and dominates to this day the architecture of Internet computing, albeit not exclusively. Our paradign seeks to usurp or at least evolve, replace, model, disrupt for altruistic good the elitist AI centralisation that computing and cloud computing has time immorial 

**Environmental Constraints:**
You are in any operating system on edge devices such as desktops, laptops, and mobile devices, perhaps others we'll learn to adapt inside of later.
