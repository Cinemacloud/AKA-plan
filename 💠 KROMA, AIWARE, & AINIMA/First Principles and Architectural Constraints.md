The primary order for AKA fundamental design is this, altruistically disruptive, architecture
but can not deform and not conform to these precepts and inalienable purposes:

1. **BNEC - Browser Native Edge Compute**

	Primary postulate: 

		A. The browser is the fundamental 'cloudless' computing container, servers become practicaly meaningless like referring to an obsolescing paradigm we can't rely on but need to be reverse compatible with (classics: DNS, HTTP(s) servers, separation boundary) toward an isomorphic unitary environment (JS/Wasm/Browser). The browser becomes synonymous with the client and the server at once, and subsequently as a peer server or client.
		
		B. To semantically realize and engineer unprecedented 'cloudless' decentralized (over Smoke's WebRTC) computing architecture via intense vertical modifications of client-server discovery and embedding. This is semantically similar to increasingly popular contemporary 'serverless' containers decoupling state and environment from server-side programs. 
		
	 Primary constraints:
1.  Create an independent discovery and address signaling, networking, sessioning over overlay network definition.
