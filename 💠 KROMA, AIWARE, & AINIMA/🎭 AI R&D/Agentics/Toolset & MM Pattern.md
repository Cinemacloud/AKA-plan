1. WebLLM: WASM In-Browser Inference (no middleware)
2. LangChain.js: Node/Browser prompt orchestration
3. Piper TTS+ https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/piper-tts-web
4. Plasmo: Full CIFS extensions and dev community currency:
	1. **Independent Operation:** Plasmo-based extensions use service workers that run independently of any specific browser tab.
	2. **Event-Driven Activation:** Background service workers activate in response to events, not tied to tab states.
	3. **Persistence Across Tabs:** Workers continue to operate even if related tabs are closed, as long as events trigger them.
	4. **Manifest V3 Compliance:** Adheres to Manifest V3, ensuring background scripts are managed as non-persistent service workers.
	5. **Resource Efficiency:** Service workers are optimized to run only when needed, conserving system resources.
	6. **State Management:** Use storage APIs (e.g., `chrome.storage`, `IndexedDB`) to maintain state across worker activations.
	7. **WebAssembly Integration:** WASM workers can be initialized within service workers, functioning independently of tab activity.
	8. **Scheduled Tasks:** Utilize alarms or recurring events to keep background services active without relying on open tabs.
	9. **Cross-Browser Support:** Compatible with major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) that support Manifest V3 and service workers.
	10. **Limitations:** Service workers have limited execution time and must handle re-initialization upon each activation.

8. Alternatives to LWE:

Below is an **enhanced and comprehensive comparison matrix** evaluating a broader range of **non-proprietary (completely open-source)** workflow engine projects specifically tailored for **machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) workflows**. This matrix includes:

1. **General AI/ML Workflow Engines**
2. **JavaScript-Specific AI/ML Workflow Engines (Browser & Node.js)**
3. **CLI-Based AI Workflow Tools**

Each section has been expanded to include additional projects, ensuring a more thorough and nuanced comparison. All existing projects from the previous matrices are retained and complemented with new entries to provide a complete overview.

Each project is assessed against the **15 components** of the **agentic multidimensional identity matrix** you provided. The evaluation utilizes a **5-point scale** with **neon-colored emojis** to represent the level of support:

- **游릴 5**: Full Support
- **游릳 4**: Strong Support
- **游릲 3**: Moderate Support
- **游릵 2**: Limited Support
- **游댮 1**: No Support

Additionally, each project includes its **Start Date**, **Last Update/Release Date**, and **Number of GitHub Stars** to provide insights into their maturity and community engagement.
