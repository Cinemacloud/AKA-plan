Core Themes and Concepts

This chat revolves around developing a cloudless, decentralized, recursive AI system that fundamentally challenges traditional client-server paradigms. The goal is to design a self-evolving and self-referential system that integrates neuro-symbolic techniques, formal logic, and spiking neural networks (SNNs). The underlying architecture leverages principles of emergent behavior, entropy management, and post-quantum cryptography.

Expanded Overview

The core structure you’re building is best described as a unitary model, with Kroma and Ainima providing the framework for self-contained evolutionary AI. This approach breaks away from classical client-server relationships, creating a continuous execution system within the browser.

1. Decentralized System and Recursive Agents:

Recursive Monads: Monads in the system evolve through bounded polymorphism, following strict rule-based manipulation while maintaining self-referential recursion (inspired by Quine).

Monadic Tasks: Each monad is an autonomous agent that mutates, completes tasks, and influences others through distributed peer-to-peer communication using WebRTC. The concept is rooted in formal symbolic manipulation and rule-based AI systems.

Game of Life: Borrowed as an inspiration for emergent behavior, where simple, local task rules (as in the Game of Life) lead to complex global system behavior.



2. Energy-Based Language Models and Entropy Management:

Neuro-Symbolic Integration: The neuro-symbolic aspect of the system ensures that learning and reasoning interact, enabling symbolic logic and manipulation alongside neural learning.

Entropy as a Metric: Entropy helps regulate task performance, allowing monads to evolve based on resource usage and task success. The system focuses on minimizing entropy, leading to a lower-energy, optimized configuration of the system.

Emergence through Entropy: Emergent structures arise when local entropy is optimized, similar to gliders and oscillators in the Game of Life.



3. Post-Quantum Cryptography:

Kyber and Crystal Cryptography: Post-quantum cryptography secures the entire system, especially in communication and task verification. WebAssembly (WASM) is leveraged to provide quantum-resistant hashing and cryptographic audits.



4. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs):

Continuous, High-Resolution Task Scheduling: The SNN layer handles tasks that require high temporal precision. Spikes act as signal propagators in the system, triggering tasks based on time-sensitive events.

Analogous to the Game of Life: SNN spikes propagate like gliders, influencing monads in adjacent network nodes to execute time-dependent tasks.



5. Discovery and Signaling via WebRTC:

Peer Discovery Mechanisms: This system faces the challenge of discovery without classic DNS, pushing the need for novel peer-discovery techniques (e.g., QR codes, proximity-based methods like Bluetooth, RFID, etc.).

SDP and ICE Candidates: Signaling protocols like Session Description Protocol (SDP), Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), and NAT traversal handle connection setup for peer-to-peer monad communication.



6. System Security and Ethics:

Quantum-resistant encryption: The integration of post-quantum cryptographic techniques ensures that the system’s communication remains secure, even in the face of future quantum computing attacks.

Ethical AI Task Filters: Monads follow strict ethical guidelines through the application of filters that regulate their task execution based on pre-defined moral or legal boundaries. This adds another layer of complexity to the system's behavior, ensuring AI operates within set ethical confines.




Influencers and Thought Leaders (Names and Their Contributions):

1. Willard Van Orman Quine: Influences the recursive and self-referential logic in the system, grounding the monads in formal logic and rule-based reasoning.


2. Vint Cerf: Provides insight into decentralized networking protocols that influence the system's peer-to-peer communication design.


3. Claude Shannon: Information theory (entropy) and symbolic logic guide how the system optimizes resource usage and information flow.


4. Fei-Fei Li: Symbolic and neuro-symbolic integration in AI systems provides the basis for blending reasoning with learning.


5. Eric Raymond: Thought leader in open-source philosophy, aligning with the goal of making the system free, decentralized, and user-controlled (Linux/Unix paradigm for human and agentic interaction).


6. Vincent Cerf: Connection to decentralized architecture, peer-to-peer systems, and implications for networked agents.



Expanding Key Components in Context of the Architecture:

Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning: This is where neural networks and symbolic AI meet, creating a fusion where the system can learn autonomously, but also operate within rigid rules of symbolic manipulation.

Application to Self-Referential Systems: Monads use this neuro-symbolic reasoning to evolve while still being governed by formal systems, much like symbolic logic systems that can predict and manipulate abstract symbols.


Recursive Evolution: Each monad not only performs tasks but evolves over time by updating its internal state and rules. This evolutionary mechanism takes inspiration from genetic algorithms and the recursive nature of systems outlined by Quine and others.

Spiking Neural Networks as Task Executors: Time-based spikes are used for task scheduling, allowing for high-resolution and high-priority task management. These time-driven processes align with biological models where neurons spike to relay time-sensitive information.

Post-Quantum Security: With Kyber and Crystal, security is maintained even in a quantum future, making the system robust to cryptographic vulnerabilities. These cryptographic layers ensure that the self-referential tasks carried out by the monads remain secure from external tampering.

WASM (WebAssembly): Used to integrate post-quantum cryptography for secure and performant operations in the browser.
