**Kroma**: Nexus Architecture for Hybrid AI/ML Cloudless Scale-Free Paradigm

Browser Native Edge ”BNE” is heterdox standards-based hyperlocal hybrid architecture, decentralizing infrastructure providing a “cloudless” WebRTC/WS overlay establishing routing from SDP endpoints and classic client-server mirror for

BNE computing fundamentally delimits and decouples meaning of conventional client-server app and userspace boundary aka browser “chrome,” in any modern browser or chromeless runtime. Offers actual serverless browser-native common serving API for spontaneous existence, scaling, and persistence. This happens via peer mesh in containerized DOM coworker optionally caching public aiware artefacts on IPFS. Kroma also supplies a lean WASM Linux VM to be used for ML and headless in-browser browser automation and Python driven ML CLI that uses Signals with WebStorage to sync.

**Aiware:** Web Componets with agentic driver, generative, iterable, and composable.

**Ainima:** Aural UX Layer for Full-duplex Debouncing Request browser API audio IO proxy to stateUserIO.
