Einstein - "We cannot solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them."

Popper - "Whenever a theory appears to you as the only possible one, take this as a sign that you have neither understood the theory nor the problem which it was intended to solve."

Turing - Instead of trying to produce a program to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the childâ€™s?"
